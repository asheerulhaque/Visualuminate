## Introduction

Data visualization is an essential part of data analysis, and this project aims to simplify the process of creating dynamic and informative data visualizations. It uses ApexCharts, a highly customizable charting library, along with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.

## Features

- Dynamic data visualization using ApexCharts.
- Data stored and retrieved from a MongoDB database.
- Interactive dashboard built with Material-UI.
- Scalable and modular MERN stack architecture.
- Easily extensible for custom data sources and chart types.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- React.js
- Material-UI
- Express.js
- ApexCharts

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
  

2. Change to the project directory:

  
   cd your-repo
   

3. Install the project dependencies. This assumes you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) already installed on your system. If not, you can download them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

   
   npm install
   

4. Set up your MongoDB database. You will need to create a MongoDB database and configure the connection in the project. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root of your project and adding the MongoDB connection URI.

   
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-uri
   

5. Start the Node.js server for the backend. This will also serve as your API for interacting with the MongoDB database.

   
   npm start
   

6. Now, open a new terminal and navigate to the `client` directory:

   
   cd client
   

7. Install the client-side dependencies:

   
   npm install
   

8. Start the React development server:

   
   npm start
   

This will start the development server for the React client. You can access the dynamic data visualization dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

You can now use the data visualization dashboard to create, view, and interact with charts and visuals based on your JSON data. The dashboard should provide an intuitive interface for adding and managing data sources and chart types.
